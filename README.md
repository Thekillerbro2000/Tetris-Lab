# Tetris-Lab

Tetris is a classic game made within java where you try and fit blocks falling from the top of the screen into each other. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you're sure of your positioning


```

## Usage

```python
import Tetris

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
